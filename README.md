Hacking with Swift: 100 Days of Swift - Project 6

## Project 6b

### Challenge

1. Replace the widthAnchor of the labels with leadingAnchor and trailingAnchor constraints, which more explicitly pin the label to the edges of its parent.
2. Once you’ve completed the first challenge, try using the safeAreaLayoutGuide for those constraints. You can see if this is working by rotating to landscape, because the labels won’t go under the safe area.
3. Make the height of the labels equal to 1/5th of the main view, minus 10 for the spacing.
